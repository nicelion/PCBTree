### How to operate

#### Plugging in and Turning on
To first turn on PCBTree, one must plug in the provided 5V AC-DC adapter into the barrel jack connector located on the beck of the device, and into the wall. 

Once this is done, the switch on the back of the device must also be switched to the "on" state, and PCBTree will then turn on.
